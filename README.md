# AI Trivia Master

Welcome to AI Trivia Master, an interactive trivia game powered by generative AI! Test your knowledge across various categories or even provide your own custom topics. The game generates questions, multiple-choice answers, and explanations on the fly, offering a unique and engaging experience every time you play.

This project is built with Next.js and leverages Genkit for its AI capabilities.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Generated Questions**: Trivia questions are dynamically generated by an AI model based on the selected topic.
- **Category Selection**: Choose from predefined categories (Science, History, Sports, Movies, Geography, Music) or enter your own custom topic.
- **Multiple Choice Answers**: Each question comes with four possible answers.
- **Explanations**: After answering, receive an explanation for the correct answer to learn more.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your correct and incorrect answers.
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: The AI attempts to adjust question difficulty based on your recent performance on a topic.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Supports English and Spanish, with language selection impacting UI text and AI-generated content.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy the game on various screen sizes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ (App Router)
- **AI Integration**: Genkit (for connecting to Google AI models)
- **UI Components**: ShadCN UI
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Internationalization**: `next-intl`

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version recommended by Next.js, e.g., 18.x or 20.x)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  Set up environment variables:
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add any necessary environment variables, particularly for Genkit and Google AI (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY`).
    Example `.env.local`:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
    ```
    Refer to Genkit documentation for more details on configuring AI models.

### Running the Development Server

To run the Next.js app and the Genkit development server concurrently (recommended):

1.  Start the Genkit development server in one terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    Or for auto-reloading on Genkit flow changes:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This server hosts your Genkit flows and makes them available for inspection and execution.

2.  Start the Next.js development server in another terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will typically start the app on `http://localhost:9002`.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Starting the Production Server

After building, you can start the production server:
```bash
npm start
```

## üìÅ Project Structure Highlights

-   `src/app/`: Main application code using Next.js App Router.
    -   `src/app/page.tsx`: The main page component for the trivia game.
    -   `src/app/layout.tsx`: The root layout for the application.
-   `src/ai/`: Genkit related files.
    -   `src/ai/flows/generate-trivia-question.ts`: The Genkit flow responsible for generating trivia questions.
    -   `src/ai/genkit.ts`: Genkit initialization and configuration.
    -   `src/ai/dev.ts`: Entry point for the Genkit development server.
-   `src/components/`: Reusable React components.
    -   `src/components/game/`: Components specific to the trivia game interface (CategorySelector, QuestionCard, ScoreDisplay).
    -   `src/components/ui/`: ShadCN UI components.
-   `src/lib/`: Utility functions and configurations.
    -   `src/lib/i18n-config.ts`: Configuration for `next-intl`.
-   `src/messages/`: JSON files for internationalization (English and Spanish).
-   `src/i18n/request.ts`: `next-intl` request configuration.

## üåê Internationalization (i18n)

The application uses `next-intl` for internationalization.
-   Translations for UI elements are stored in `src/messages/en.json` and `src/messages/es.json`.
-   The selected language is persisted in a cookie (`NEXT_LOCALE`).
-   The AI is instructed to generate trivia questions and explanations in the selected language.

## ü§ñ Genkit AI Integration

-   Genkit is used to define and run AI flows.
-   The primary flow, `generateTriviaQuestionFlow` (in `src/ai/flows/generate-trivia-question.ts`), interacts with an AI model (e.g., Gemini) to produce trivia content.
-   The Genkit development UI can be accessed (usually at `http://localhost:4000`) when `npm run genkit:dev` or `npm run genkit:watch` is running, allowing you to inspect flows and traces.
