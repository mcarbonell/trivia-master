# AI Trivia Master

Welcome to AI Trivia Master, an interactive trivia game powered by generative AI! Test your knowledge across various categories or even provide your own custom topics. The game generates questions, multiple-choice answers, and explanations on the fly, offering a unique and engaging experience every time you play.

This project is built with Next.js and leverages Genkit for its AI capabilities.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Generated Questions**: Trivia questions are dynamically generated by an AI model based on the selected topic.
- **Category Selection**: Choose from predefined categories (Science, History, Sports, Movies, Geography, Music) or enter your own custom topic.
- **Multiple Choice Answers**: Each question comes with four possible answers.
- **Explanations**: After answering, receive an explanation for the correct answer to learn more.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your correct and incorrect answers.
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: The AI attempts to adjust question difficulty based on your recent performance on a topic.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Supports English and Spanish, with language selection impacting UI text and AI-generated content.

- **Admin Panel**:
    - Secure admin area accessible via Firebase Authentication (email/password).
    - Dashboard for quick navigation within the admin panel.
    - **Category Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for trivia categories, including defining names, icons, AI prompt instructions, and difficulty-specific guidelines. View counts of predefined questions per difficulty for each category.
    - **Question Management**: View a paginated list of all predefined questions. Filter questions by category and difficulty. Edit existing questions (all bilingual content, difficulty, correct answer). Delete unwanted predefined questions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version recommended by Next.js, e.g., 18.x or 20.x)
- npm or yarn
- Firebase Project: You'll need a Firebase project set up.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  Set up environment variables:
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project. Populate it with your Firebase project configuration details (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.) and your Google AI API key. Example:
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_firebase_measurement_id
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
    ```
    Refer to Firebase and Genkit documentation for more details.

4.  **Firebase Setup**:
    *   In your Firebase project, enable **Firestore Database**.
    *   Enable **Firebase Authentication** with the "Email/Password" sign-in provider.
    *   Manually create an admin user in the Firebase Authentication console to access the admin panel.

### Running the Development Server

To run the Next.js app and the Genkit development server concurrently (recommended):

1.  Start the Genkit development server in one terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    Or for auto-reloading on Genkit flow changes:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This server hosts your Genkit flows and makes them available for inspection and execution.

2.  Start the Next.js development server in another terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will typically start the app on `http://localhost:9002`. The admin panel will be accessible at `http://localhost:9002/login`.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Starting the Production Server

After building, you can start the production server:
```bash
npm start
```

## üìÅ Project Structure Highlights

-   `src/app/`: Main application code using Next.js App Router.
    -   `src/app/page.tsx`: The main page component for the trivia game.
    -   `src/app/layout.tsx`: The root layout for the application.
    -   `src/app/login/page.tsx`: Admin login page.
    -   `src/app/admin/`: Contains pages for the admin panel (dashboard, categories, questions).
        - `src/app/admin/layout.tsx`: Layout for the admin section, handles authentication.
-   `src/ai/`: Genkit related files.
    -   `src/ai/flows/generate-trivia-question.ts`: The Genkit flow responsible for generating trivia questions.
    -   `src/ai/genkit.ts`: Genkit initialization and configuration.
    -   `src/ai/dev.ts`: Entry point for the Genkit development server.
-   `src/components/`: Reusable React components.
    -   `src/components/game/`: Components specific to the trivia game interface.
    -   `src/components/ui/`: ShadCN UI components.
-   `src/contexts/`: React Context providers.
    -   `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`: Manages Firebase authentication state.
-   `src/lib/`: Utility functions and configurations.
    -   `src/lib/i18n-config.ts`: Configuration for `next-intl`.
    -   `src/lib/firebase.ts`: Firebase initialization.
-   `src/messages/`: JSON files for internationalization.
-   `src/services/`: Service functions for interacting with Firestore (categoryService, triviaService).
-   `src/scripts/`: Utility scripts for populating Firestore.

## üåê Internationalization (i18n)

The application uses `next-intl` for internationalization.
-   Translations for UI elements are stored in `src/messages/en.json` and `src/messages/es.json`.
-   The selected language is persisted in a cookie (`NEXT_LOCALE`).
-   The AI is instructed to generate trivia questions and explanations in the selected language.
-   The admin panel is also bilingual.

## ü§ñ Genkit AI Integration

-   Genkit is used to define and run AI flows.
-   The primary flow, `generateTriviaQuestionsFlow` (in `src/ai/flows/generate-trivia-question.ts`), interacts with an AI model (e.g., Gemini) to produce trivia content.
-   The Genkit development UI can be accessed (usually at `http://localhost:4000`) when `npm run genkit:dev` or `npm run genkit:watch` is running, allowing you to inspect flows and traces.
